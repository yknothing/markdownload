# MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/deathau/markdownload?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/releases/latest)

This is an extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file. Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.

To use this add-on, simply click the add-on icon while you are browsing the page you want to save offline. A popup will show the rendered markdown so you can make minor edits or copy the text, or you can click the download button to download an .md file.  
Selecting text will allow you to download just the selected text

See the [Markdownload User Guide](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/blob/master/user-guide.md#markdownload-user-guide) for more details on the functionality of this extension

## Pricing
This is an open-source extension I made *for fun*. Its intention is to be completely free.
It's free on Firefox, Edge and Chrome (and other Chromium browsers),
but unfortunately for Safari there is a yearly developer fee, so I've decided to
charge a small price for the Safari version to help cover that cost.
Alternately, you can become a GitHub Sponsor for as little as $2 per month and
you can request a key for the Safari version.
Also, even if you're using the free version and you absolutely *have* to
send me money because you like it that much, feel free to throw some coins
in my hat via the following:
